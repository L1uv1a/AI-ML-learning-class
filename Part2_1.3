    Evaluate the performance of decision trees,
    averaged over 1,000 trials of 10-fold cross validation

    Return:
      a matrix giving the performance that will contain the following entries:
      stats[0,0] = mean accuracy of decision tree
      stats[0,1] = std deviation of decision tree accuracy
      stats[1,0] = mean accuracy of decision stump
      stats[1,1] = std deviation of decision stump
      stats[2,0] = mean accuracy of 3-level decision tree
      stats[2,1] = std deviation of 3-level decision tree

    ** Note that your implementation must follow this API**
